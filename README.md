# Talaash-Hindi-Search-Engine
Talash: A search engine for Hindi language is used for finding Hindi books based on author, itâ€™s genre or by quoting the plot of the stories. The search engine developed using python and Tkinter (for GUI) gives a comparison between the performance of the system when using positional and  inverted index (in terms of time of retrieval) along with its search  capabilities. Also, the use of stemmer while indexing reduces the  index size and results in faster and better retrieval. The ability to  search specifically, on the basis of category adds to the functionality.
